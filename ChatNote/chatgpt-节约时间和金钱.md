帮我翻译这篇文章为中文： \[The Simple Mental Model That Changed My Financial Life | by Darius Foroux | Feb, 2023 | Medium\](https://dariusforoux.medium.com/the-simple-mental-model-that-changed-my-financial-life-506aae5109fb) ## Focus on the big-money decisions !\[\](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\*j\_OFXFUEVfBJ0q04lm3RMg.jpeg) When it comes to spending money, I’ve made so many mistakes. When I think about the amount of money I’ve wasted in the past, I feel bad in my stomach. I didn’t have the best mental model for my financial life back then. As someone who practices Stoicism and Mindfulness, I \[don’t get attached to those feelings\](https://dariusforoux.com/detachment-vs-non-attachment/). But still, it does hurt a little bit. For instance, I think I bought a new winter jacket almost every year until four or five years ago when I finally decided to spend a grand on a high-quality jacket. I spent probably twice as much in the ten prior years. But now that I have a great (and warm) winter parka, I don’t even think about getting a new one. So I’m not spending any more money. I’m also not spending time and energy on finding new jackets. \*\*I call this way of looking at the world, or mental model, “Save time and money by spending well.”\*\* In most languages, there’s a saying that captures that philosophy. In The Netherlands, we say, “Buying cheap is expensive.” But this is not only true for buying things. In this article, I will share 3 personal examples of my life where I applied this mental model and how it changed my life financially. ## Writing books When I wrote my first book in 2015, I didn’t do a great job with the presentation and positioning. I called the book \_Massive Life Success\_, and I created a silly cover on Canva in 30 minutes. Here it is: !\[\](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\*FXxBUU9C6PdP\_9Eb) It doesn’t even look a little bit like my current books. I didn’t have a logo nor did I have a style. The overall feel of the book was amateurish. A few weeks after I published it, I started feeling bad about the book. I liked the content and advice, but it just didn’t look professional. So I took a lot of time and energy to study \[the book business\](https://dariusforoux.com/book-business/). I also worked on creating a style for all my designs. Call it a brand identity. And within a year, I republished the book as, \[Win Your Inner Battles\](https://amzn.to/3EesHDb). It came with a new title, cover, and description. I even re-arranged the chapters, which made the reading experience easier. Now, seven years later, the book is still selling hundreds of copies a month. I learned an important lesson from that experience. When you’re working on a project, it’s tempting to rush it and finish it as fast as you can. You can just “ship it” and move on to the next one. Don’t be one of those people who turns everything into a rush job. Take your time. Invest time and energy in your projects. Do a GREAT job. Do the job as best as you can. The first time, I didn’t spend enough time and money on my book. So I got a book that wasn’t great. Then, I spent serious time and money on creating the best book I could. And that book is still earning money today. ## Traveling I can’t stand traveling. I honestly get so annoyed when I’m in airports, on planes, on trains, or standing in line anywhere. But at the same time, I do like to go on vacation or visit nice places in the world. And I do it in a very distinct (and weird) way. I have a bunch of made up rules around traveling. For example, I avoid airports at all costs during the summer holiday. I just don’t want to be anywhere close to an airport during holidays. Not worth it. Also, no vacation package deals for me. You know, those package deals some airlines offer that include a plane ticket, shuttle, and hotel. I went to many of those when I was young, and I’ve had enough. In short, I do everything I can to avoid busy periods and popular destinations. Paris in July? I’d rather eat a bowl of nuts and bolts. New York City during Christmas? No thank you, I’d like to stay sane. When I travel by plane, I book a seat right behind business class. And if I can get an upgrade upon check-in, I go for it. But I prefer to drive. I live in The Netherlands, and I even drove all the way to the south of Spain. At least I don’t have to get in lines. And if I have to spend more money on travel? So what? At least I enjoy the entire experience from the moment I leave my house. To me, that’s when traveling starts. Because I’m such a difficult person when it comes to traveling, I try not to travel a lot. I’d rather go on one great trip than a few “normal” ones. ## Personal productivity Most people in the productivity space are always interested in new apps, tools, and methods. I’m not. I’ve done my research years ago. In fact, I started researching productivity when I was in university, and I spent years to find \[a good productivity system that worked\](https://members.dariusforoux.com/procrastinate-zero-2) for me. I spent time and money on books, courses, apps, tools. It was a huge investment, both time-wise and money-wise. But now, I’m done. I no longer have to spend time and money on anything that’s related to productivity. I’m good. It was something I had to work on once, and now I simply stick to my strategy. I don’t look at new apps or systems. The things I use work fine. Why change a winning team? This is a good example of “Save time and money by spending well.” When you spend well, you usually only have to spend once. So many people don’t take their productivity seriously. They don’t research it enough. They don’t take courses. They read a few articles or a book and think that’s it. But productivity is a personal thing. You must find \[a system that works for you\](https://dariusforoux.com/productivity-distraction-age/). When you make a proper time investment, you only have to do it once. When you finally have a system that works for you, you can honestly rely on it for the rest of your life. ## Focus on the big-money decisions Look, life is short. It’s tempting to focus on quick ways you can save money. If you save on your groceries today, you will spend less. That’s a fact. But that’s not the \[key to changing your finances.\](https://dariusforoux.com/personal-finance-guide/) The key is to adopt a way of life that helps you to get richer in the long term. Think about the big decisions you’re making. Are they making you poorer in the long term? Or are you getting richer? A very obvious example is \[leasing cars\](https://dariusforoux.com/consumerism/). You’re paying a huge premium today to drive that car. You could use that premium to do a million other good things. When you focus on these types of big decisions, you will make life easier for yourself. Think about your future self. You want to make sure you’re better off in a year than now.

聚焦于重要的资金决策

当涉及到花钱时，我犯了很多错误。当我想到过去浪费的钱时，我感到内疚。

那时我没有为我的财务生活找到最好的思维模式。

作为一个实践stoicism和mindfulness的人，我不会沉迷于这些感觉。但是，我还是有点难受。

例如，我认为直到四五年前，我几乎每年都买一件新的冬季外套，直到我最终决定花一千美元购买一件高质量的外套。

在之前的十年中，我花费的钱可能是现在的两倍。但是现在我有一件很棒（也很暖和）的冬季大衣，我甚至不考虑再买一件。因此，我没有再花费任何钱。我也不用花时间和精力去找新的外套。

我称这种看待世界的方式或思维模式为“通过理性消费来节约时间和金钱”。

在大多数语言中，都有一句话来概括这种哲学。在荷兰，我们说：“买便宜的东西是昂贵的。”但这不仅适用于购买物品。

在本文中，我将分享三个个人例子，展示我如何应用这种思维模式并改变了我的财务生活。

写作书籍
----

2015年我写了第一本书，但在宣传和定位方面做得并不好。

我把这本书称为《全面成功人生》，并在Canva上创建了一个愚蠢的封面，只花了30分钟。这就是它的样子：

![image.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2023/png/973443/1646158543233-d3a8c44e-a575-4fcb-bad2-4c4f4a315db4.png#clientId=ub83e6f1d-84b2-4&from=paste&id=uc631ce36&margin=%5Bobject%20Object%5D&originHeight=1512&originWidth=1076&originalType=binary&ratio=1&size=342701&status=done&style=none&taskId=u21096e47-f14b-4a4a-9ad2-d93ab1e5d5d) 看起来一点都不像我的现在的书。我没有标志，也没有风格。整个书籍的感觉很业余。

发布几周后，我开始对这本书感到不满意。我喜欢其中的内容和建议，但它看起来并不专业。因此，我花费了大量的时间和精力来研

究图书业务。

我还努力为所有设计创建一种风格。可以称之为品牌识别。在一年内，我重新发布了这本书，名为《赢得内心的战斗》。

它带有新的标题、封面和描述。我甚至重新排列了章节，使阅读体验更加流畅。

现在，七年过去了，这本书仍然每个月销售数百本。我从这次经历中学到了一个重要的教训。

当你正在进行一个项目时，很容易匆忙完成它。你可以只是“发布”它，然后转向下一个项目。

不要成为那些把所有事情都变成紧急任务的人之一。花时间，投入时间和精力在你的项目中。做得很好。尽可能做到最好。

第一次，我没有在书上花足够的时间和金钱。所以我得到了一本不太好的书。然后，我花费了大量时间和金钱来创建最好的书。

而这本书现在仍在赚钱。

旅行
--

我无法忍受旅行。当我在机场、飞机上、火车上或任何地方排队等候时，我真的很烦恼。

但同时，我确实喜欢去度假或参观世界上的美丽地方。

我以一种非常特殊（也有些奇怪）的方式去做。我对旅行有一堆虚构的规则。例如，在暑假期间我会尽可能避免去机场。我只是不想在节假日期间靠近机场。不值得。

对我来说，也不会选择度假套餐。你知道，那些航空公司提供的包括机票、班车和酒店的套餐。我年轻的时候去过很多次，已经够了。

简而言之，我尽我所能避免繁忙期和热门目的地。七月的巴黎？我宁愿吃一碗螺丝钉。圣诞节期间的纽约市？不，谢谢，我想保持理智。

当我乘飞机旅行时，我会预订商务舱的后座。如果我可以在办理登机手续时升级，我会选择升级。但我更喜欢开车。我住在荷兰，甚至开车一直开到西班牙南部。

至少我不必排队。如果我需要在旅行上花更多的钱？那又怎么样呢？至少我从

离家出发时就享受整个旅程。对我来说，这才是旅行开始的时刻。

因为我在旅行方面很困难，所以我尽量少旅行。我宁愿去一个很棒的旅行，也不愿意去几个“普通”的旅行。

个人生产力
-----

生产力领域中的大多数人都对新的应用程序、工具和方法感兴趣。

但我不是。

多年前，我已经做过了我的研究。事实上，当我还在大学时就开始研究生产力，我花了很多年的时间找到适合我的[有效的生产力系统](https://members.dariusforoux.com/procrastinate-zero-2)。

我花费时间和金钱买书、上课、买应用、工具。这是一项巨大的投资，不论是时间方面还是金钱方面。

但现在，我做到了。我不再需要花时间和金钱去研究任何与生产力相关的事情。我做得很好。这是我曾经必须努力工作的事情，现在我只需要坚持我的策略就可以了。

我不看新的应用程序或系统。我用的东西很好。为什么改变一支胜利的球队呢？

这是“通过理性消费来节省时间和金钱”的一个好例子。

当你消费得当时，通常只需要消费一次。因此，许多人不会认真对待他们的生产力。他们没有充分研究它。他们不上课。

他们只看了几篇文章或一本书，然后就认为这就是全部。但生产力是一件个人的事情。你必须找到适合你的[系统](https://dariusforoux.com/productivity-distraction-age/)。

当你做出适当的时间投资时，你只需要做一次。当你终于有一个适合你的系统时，你可以真诚地依赖它，让它伴随你的余生。

聚焦于重要的资金决策
----------

生命是短暂的。专注于你可以节省的快速方式很诱人。

如果你今天节省了杂货的钱，你将花费更少的钱。这是事实。但这并不是[改变你的财务状况的关键。](https://dariusforoux.com/personal-finance-guide/)

关键是采取一种有助于长期变得更富有的生活方式。想想你正在做出的重大决策。
