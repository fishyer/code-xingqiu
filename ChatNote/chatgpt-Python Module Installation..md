ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'colorlog'

**ChatGPT:**

The "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'colorlog'" error message typically indicates that the Python module "colorlog" is not installed on your system.

To resolve this error, you can try installing the "colorlog" module using a package manager like pip. Open a command prompt or terminal window and type the following command:

```
pip install colorlog
```

If you're using a specific version of Python (such as Python 3), you may need to use a version-specific pip command. For example, on some systems, you might need to use the following command instead:

```
pip3 install colorlog
```

Once you've installed the "colorlog" module, you should be able to import it in your Python code without encountering the "ModuleNotFoundError" exception.
