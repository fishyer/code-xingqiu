ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mysql'

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

This error message indicates that Python cannot find the "mysql" module, which is necessary for the program to run.

To resolve this issue, you need to make sure that the "mysql" module is installed in your Python environment. You can do this by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:

```
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

This command will install the "mysql-connector-python" module, which provides connectivity to a MySQL database using Python.

If you are still encountering issues, make sure that your Python environment is correctly configured and that you are using the correct version of Python.
