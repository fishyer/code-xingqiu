**ChatGPT:**

The error message "TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment" usually occurs when you try to change or modify an element within a tuple, which is not allowed because tuples are immutable in Python.

Looking at the code you provided, it seems that there is an issue with the expected output list. Specifically, the third item in the expected list does not have a corresponding value in the original `date_list` input. Additionally, it seems like there is a missing comma in the fourth item of the expected list.

Here's a corrected version of the code that should fix the issues:

```scss
def test_format_date():
        date_list = [
            (datetime.datetime(2022, 1, 1), 1),
            (datetime.datetime(2022, 2, 1), 2),
            (datetime.datetime(2022, 3, 1), 3),
        ]
        expected = [
            ("2022-01-01", 1),
            ("2022-02-01", 2),
            ("2022-03-01", None),
            (datetime.datetime(2022, 3, 1), 3),
        ]
        assert format_date(date_list) == expected
```

This code sets the third item in the `expected` list to `None` since there is no corresponding value for that date in the `date_list`. It also adds a comma between the date and the number in the fourth item of the `expected` list to make it a tuple.
